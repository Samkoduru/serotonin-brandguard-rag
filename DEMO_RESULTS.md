# BrandGuard RAG Demo Results & Validation

## üìã Problem Statement Requirements

From **Problemstatement.md**, the LLMs tend to:
1. ‚ùå **Lose or forget specific instructions over time**
2. ‚ùå **Mix styles or tones from unrelated inputs**  
3. ‚ùå **Combine disparate elements in a way that feels inconsistent or off-brand**

**Objective:** Ensure reliable, consistent AI outputs tailored to:
- ‚úÖ A specific client
- ‚úÖ A specific type of deliverable (e.g., blog post, product update, etc.)
- ‚úÖ A specific style and tone aligned with that client's preferences

## üéØ Demo 1: Core Functionality Test

### Client Profile: Alchemy
- **Voice:** Professional, technical, and solution-oriented
- **Tone:** Direct, authoritative, developer-focused
- **Required Terms:** EIP-7702, smart contract, gas sponsorship, batch transactions, EOA, onchain
- **Forbidden Terms:** revolutionary, game-changing, disrupting, amazing

### Test Case 1.1: Product Update

**Input Query:**
```
"Draft a product update about our new EIP-7702 support focusing on developer benefits like gas sponsorship and transaction batching"
```

**Generated Response:**
```
Alchemy now supports EIP-7702, enabling developers to sponsor gas fees and batch transactions for users. This implementation allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act as smart contract wallets for single transactions.

Key developer benefits:
- Gas sponsorship eliminates user friction during onboarding
- Batch transactions improve efficiency and reduce costs
- Smart contract functionality without requiring users to deploy contracts
- Seamless integration with existing Alchemy Account Contracts

This technical advancement enhances user experience while maintaining the security and decentralization principles that define the platform.

**Input Query:**
```
"Write a blog post explaining how EIP-7702 improves user onboarding for web3 applications"
```

**Generated Response:**
```
Alchemy now supports EIP-7702, enabling developers to sponsor gas fees and batch transactions for users. This implementation allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act as smart contract wallets for single transactions.
