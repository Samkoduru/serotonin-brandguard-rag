AI Automation Engineer Assignment
Due: Friday, July 18
Context
Team: Content Team
This team is responsible for producing long-form articles, blogs, and product updates for our
clients.
Problem Statement
When using large language models (LLMs), we often upload a client’s background information,
brand guidelines, and previous deliverables to generate new content. However, the LLMs tend
to:
● Lose or forget specific instructions over time,
● Mix styles or tones from unrelated inputs,
● Combine disparate elements in a way that feels inconsistent or off-brand.
● This makes it difficult to generate high-quality, on-brand content reliably and efficiently.
Objective
Propose and/or prototype an AI solution that ensures reliable, consistent AI outputs tailored to:
● A specific client
● A specific type of deliverable (e.g., blog post, product update, etc.)
● A specific style and tone aligned with that client’s preferences
